# dotfiles

Less is more. This repository contains all my dotfiles for frequently used software as minimal as possible.
Altough it's part of my ansible archlinux automation, it should work as a standalone configuration method.

# how to manage

Clone this repository, then invoke the install script.

```bash
$ ./install_dotfiles.sh
```
